    "How do you prove a quantum computer actually did something no classical computer can? Are there problems that a quantum computer can solve efficiently, but that would take a classical machine an unreasonable perhaps even cosmic amount of time? These questions sit at the heart of quantum advantage, one of the most important unsolved puzzles of quantum advantage.\n",

    "To answer these questions, researchers design specific computational tasks often based on sampling from quantum circuits and then try to show two things: first, that a quantum computer can perform the task efficiently, and second, that no classical computer can do the same without an exponential blowup in time or resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach led to landmark experiments like Google's 2019 quantum supremacy demonstration, where their Sycamore processor completed a sampling task in 200 seconds that would have taken classical supercomputers an estimated 10²⁵ years <sup>[1]</sup>. \n",

    "\n",
    "But proving quantum advantage isn't just about speed, it also demands verification. If a quantum computer produces an answer that no classical machine can reproduce, how do we check that the answer is actually correct? This tension between hardness and verifiability is what drives the search for better quantum advantage candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Peaked quantum circuits are a candidate for demonstrating quantum advantage, as introduced by Aaronson and Zhang <sup>[[2]](#ref2)</sup>, which change the game. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "A peaked quantum circuit is a quantum circuit whose output probability distribution concentrates heavily on a single computational basis state,i.e. a hidden bitstring.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "However, unlike random circuits, peaked circuits are much easier to verify because their outputs have high concentrations on a computational basis state: simply run them on a quantum computer and check whether you recover the correct hidden bitstring. Verification in classical computer grows exponentially with the number of qubits. So, we might get a quantum advantage by this property.\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "A good peaked circuit must look indistinguishable from a random circuit to any classical observer, much like a cryptographic hash function: easy to verify, hard to reverse-engineer. So, peaked circuit have potential to be used in ***post quantum cryptography***.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In this challenge, you will learn what peaked circuits are, how to construct them by augmenting random circuits with optimized peaking layers, and how to verify quantum outputs using the hidden peak and a bunch of mathematical proofs that is needed to deeply understand.\n",
